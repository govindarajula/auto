# Obstacle classification in images using deep learning
* Developed an image prediction algorithm upon the Theano library using the CIFAR-10 dataset, for vision system of a car for on-road obstacles.
* Improved processing by a factor of 10 by deploying on Amazon EC2(GPU-enabled virtual machine).

* Tools used: (Theano,Lasagne,Nolearn,Amazon EC2)

Footnotes:

    Network-in-network layers: These are small neural networks that are easier to interpret than traditional 
    neural network layers.
    Dropout layers: These randomly drop units during training, preventing overfitting, which is a major problem
    in neural networks.
    Noise layers: These introduce noise into the neurons; again, addressing the overfitting problem.
