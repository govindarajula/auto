#### Autonomous vehicle study (indpenedent multi-disciplinary project):

##### Obstacle classification in images using deep learning
* Developed an image prediction algorithm upon the Theano library using the CIFAR-10 dataset, for vision system of a car for on-road obstacles. Improved processing by a factor of 10 by deploying on Amazon EC2(GPU-enabled virtual machine).

##### Drive-by-wire Steering Design
* Designed a simulation of steering mechanism of an autonomous car, on the Simulink environment, with CarSim and SimScape.
* Proposed model incorporates ECU unit and sensors upon a Power assisted steering mechanism and tested by simulations for constant and variable speeds studying torsion, yaw and acceleration.




* Tools used: (Theano, Matlab, Simulink, CAD, Mechanics, ECU, Lasagne,Nolearn,Amazon EC2)

Footnotes:

    Network-in-network layers: These are small neural networks that are easier to interpret than traditional 
    neural network layers.
    Dropout layers: These randomly drop units during training, preventing overfitting, which is a major problem
    in neural networks.
    Noise layers: These introduce noise into the neurons; again, addressing the overfitting problem.
